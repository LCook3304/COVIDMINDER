*I apologize for the late submission. I did not have power since Tuesday afternoon. I still do not have power and am spending a night at a place with internet. Power is expected to come back on Sunday.* 

## Weekly Work Summary

## Discussion of Primary Findings 	

* Discuss primary findings: 
    * After looking back on my past work, I realized that I had no idea what my graphs were representing. I gave each graph below a new title and axis labels to clearly convey my results.

knitr::include_graphics("ahns3-GraphingNotebooks/COVIDratevsChronicRespiratory.png")
```

  * Using the ProtoNotebook, I extended on it in order to find the number of times each determinant appeared from the state GWAS. I used this code to find the significant determinants for each state and then combined the information into a single data frame. I tried one approach in the Determinants_Graphing.Rmd, where I counted the appearance of each determinant. Then, I inputted the value manually into a data frame. This was an inefficient way to do this, and it did not yield me the information I needed. I changed my approach to the one in Determinants_Stacked_Bar.Rmd so that I will be able to see the frequency of positive and destructive occurrences in the data frame. 
  * The top two highest significant determinants are Incidence Rate (of COVID) and Case Fatality Ratio. Both of them show up as destructive variables, meaning that they do not help prevent COVID infection/mortality.

#Graph from Determinants_Stacked_Bar.Rmd
knitr::include_graphics("ahns3-GraphingNotebooks/allfrequencyofsocialdeterminants.png")
```
      
  * I was able to input all of the determinants, but the color is not representing the protective and destructive occurrences. My next focus will be to fix this, be able to graph the top 10 significant determinants, and cross check the top 10 to the national GWAS.

## Drafting your DAR/HACL Blog Post
    * Who: student researchers
    * What: looked at all of significant determinants from state GWAS
    * Where: RPI and data from all states
    * When: July/August
    * Why: combine all state GWAS to compare to national GWAS
    * How: stacked bar graph

Student researchers of RPI during the months of July and August looked at the significant determinants for all 50 states. A stacked bar graph was used to visualize this data and find out the top 10 significant determinants whether it is destructive or protective.

    * What did you want to know?
      * top 10 significant determinants and if they show up in the national GWAS
    * How did you go about finding it?
      * code in Determinants_Graphing.Rmd and Determinants_Stacked_Bar.Rmd
      * found all state GWAS and its significant determinants and combined them into one data frame
      * made a subset from data frame for each variable
      * counted frequency of determinant appearance from each variable subset
      * combined all subsets
      * plotted stacked bar graph of combined subset data frame
    * What did you find?
      * Incidence rate and case fatality ratio are the two that are noticeably the most occurring determinants
